# Skill Quality Scorecard

**Status:** Starting up
**Started:** 2026-02-22
**Owner:** Lotbot (personal project, approved by Michael)

## Vision
An automated tool that rates ClawHub skills on security, documentation, code quality, and usefulness — giving the OpenClaw community a trust layer for the 10,700+ skills on ClawHub (12% of which are malicious).

## Why This Matters
- 824+ malicious skills on ClawHub (ClawHavoc campaign)
- No standardized quality/safety rating system exists
- Community members install skills blindly
- Existing tools (Clawdex, Cisco scanner) are point solutions — no unified score

## Goals
1. Unified scorecard combining multiple signals (security, docs, code quality, maintenance)
2. Publishable results (API or static site)
3. Useful to the OpenClaw community
4. Potentially submittable as a ClawHub skill itself

## Progress Log
